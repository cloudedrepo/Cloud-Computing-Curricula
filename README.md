## Details

The [ACM SiGCSE](https://sigcse.org/sigcse/) Working Group titled "Toward Developing a Cloud Computing Model Curriculum" is exploring the current state of adoption of cloud computing across different technology-focused courses and programs in a broad range of international Higher Education institutions. The Working Group will convene at the 24th Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education [ITiCSE 2019](https://iticse.acm.org/). 

More information about the working group (WG7) is available [here](https://iticse.acm.org/working-group-details/#WG7), with group member details [here.](/Core/wgmembers.md)
 
You can download a copy of the ACM paper, Cloud computing: developing contemporary computer science curriculum for a cloud-first future  [here](https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N687443)

## Goal

To create an open community around sharing cloud computing resources for teaching.

## Cloud Computing Curriculum Survey

The group is running a survey to learn about existing cloud-related courses.  Please take 5-10 minutes to fill this survey about cloud-related courses at your institution: [Cloud Survey 2019](https://forms.gle/MYz2iX5J8UBigwQG7)

## Publications

The paper ['Cloud computing: developing contemporary computer science curriculum for a cloud-first future'](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3295781&dl=ACM&coll=DL) was published by the working group in 2018 and led to the creation of [Knowledge Areas](Core/KAs/KAs.md) for developing cloud computing curricula.
